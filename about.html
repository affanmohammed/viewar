<P>Science has brought a lot of changes in our daily life. In today’s modern world everything is moving toward the era of the internet. We started by sending emails to each other, socializing, watching fun leisure videos, entertaining stuff, studying and even working on it. A world without the internet is not something one can imagine. As all things have changed due to the internet so has shopping. One could say the newer generation is lazy. No one wants to buy a product only to be later dissatisfied due to the minor inconvenience brought due to something which was hidden when exploring the product or due to a non-compatibility with surroundings/ surrounding decor. The solution is to move into the world of Augmented Reality (AR). A world where everything is virtually true. Using AR one can view the object he intends on buying. The buyer can make sure the product looks to his expectation from any angle. This also allows the user to interact, inspect and get familiar with the product in real-time. This can prevent the user from making wrong decisions. No one wants to buy a product that doesn’t meet his /her expectation and then later on go through the hassle to return or replace the product. The expectations of a buyer are set better because the buyer gets the opportunity to test the compatibility of a product to the buyer’s current environment. To put the solution into the real world the seller must provide face images of the product and required dimensions using which a model can be generated which will be shown to the seller. The AR view should take into consideration the surrounding environment and the size of the product so that proper space and features are maintained.</P>
